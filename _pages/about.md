Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University specializing in American politics and political theory with a focus on American political institutions and thought. My research broadly examines how American political institutions were originally designed and how they have developed in response to changing environments. Currently, I focus on representation, polarization, and populism in the United States. I study these topics both theoretically and empirically by using a mixed-method approach that integrates normative and formal theories, historical analysis, and quantitative research methods.
