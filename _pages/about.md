Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University, specializing in race, ethnicity, and politics and American political thought. I am particularly interested in how racial inequality threatens American democracy and how American statesmen, such as Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, have endeavored to solve racial issues. My research interests include American slavery, racial prejudice, racial health disparities, racial threat, populism, etc. I study these topics both theoretically and empirically, analyzing foundational political texts and the speeches of American statesmen, as well as conducting empirical research using causal inference methods.
