Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University. Studying American politics and political theory, I am particularly interested in the historical development of political polarization (both ideological and affective) and its implications for representation in the US. My research employs normative theories, historical analysis, and quantitative research methods.
