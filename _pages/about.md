Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University, specializing in American politics and political theory with a focus on racial and ethnic politics, American political thought, and health politics. I am particularly interested in how racial inequality worsens American democracy and population health, and how American statesmen, such as Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, have endeavored to solve racial issues. To study these topics, I use various theories and methods developed from philosophy, psychology, epidemiology, economics, as well as political science.
