Hello. I am a Ph.D. student in political science at Claremont Graduate University. Studying American political institutions, I am particularly interested in how and for what the American political institutions were originally designed, and how the system is obstructed by economic inequality, racial conflict, and partisan polarization. My research employs normative and positive theories, and quantitative research methods.
