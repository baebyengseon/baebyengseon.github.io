Welcome to my academic website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University, specializing in American political thought and Race, Ethnicity, and Politics (REP). I am particularly interested in how Amerian statesmen have addressed racial issues and how to reduce racial inequality in the United States. I study these topics both theoretically and empirically, analyzing foundational political texts and the speeches of American statesmen, as well as conducting empirical research.
