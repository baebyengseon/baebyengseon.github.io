Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University. Studying American political thought and development, I am interested in the principles and purposes of American political institutions and how these institutions have developed historically. My study of American political institutions includes the Congress, the President, the Supreme Court, separation of powers, federalism, representation, and political parties. In addition, I am also interested in social institutions which are politically important such as slavery, family, and religion. My research employs normative theories, historical analysis, and quantitative research methods.
