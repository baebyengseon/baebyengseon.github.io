Hello. I am a Ph.D. student in political science at Claremont Graduate University. Studying American political institutions, I am particularly interested in on what principles and for what American political institutions were originally designed, and how the political system is obstructed by economic inequality, racial prejudice, and partisan polarization (e.g., gridlock, low legitimacy, populism, etc). My research employs normative and positive theories, and quantitative research methods.
