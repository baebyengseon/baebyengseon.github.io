Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University (CGU) specializing in American politics including American political institutions and behavior, and American political thought and development. I study race and representation with a theoretically informed and methodologically rigorous mixed-method approach that integrates normative and formal theories, historical analysis, and quantitative research methods. I am particularly interested in how racial inequalities exacerbate political polarization (both ideological and affective) and thus undermine representation in the US.
