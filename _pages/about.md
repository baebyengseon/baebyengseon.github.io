Hello. I am a PhD candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University. I study American politics and political theory with a focus on the economic and racial causes of political polarization (both ideological and affective) and its consequences on representation in the US. My research employs normative and formal theories, historical analysis, and quantitative research methods.
