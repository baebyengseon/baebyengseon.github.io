Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University. My research is centered on American political institutions, development, and thought, with special interests in questions of representation and identity in the United States. I study these topics both theoretically and empirically by using a mixed-method approach that integrates normative and formal theories, historical analysis, and quantitative research methods.
