Hello. I am a PhD candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University. I study representation with emphasis on the economic and racial causes of political polarization (both ideological and affective) and the consequences of polarization on representation in the US. My research employs normative and formal theories, historical analysis, and quantitative research methods.
