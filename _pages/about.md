Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University, specializing in American politics and political theory with a focus on racial and ethnic politics, representation, and American political thought. I am particularly interested in how racial inequality threatens American democracy and how American statesmen, such as Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, have endeavored to solve racial issues. To study the role of race in American politics, I use various theories and methods developed from philosophy, psychology, economics, biology, as well as political science.
