Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University specializing in American politics and political theory. My research broadly examines American political institutions and their philosophical foundations. Currently, I focus on representation, polarization, and populism in the United States. I study these topics both theoretically and empirically by using a mixed-method approach that integrates normative and formal theories, historical analysis, and quantitative research methods.
