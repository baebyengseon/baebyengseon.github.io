Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University, specializing in American political institutions and thought. I am particularly interested in how American political institutions were originally designed to prevent populism in a government based on popular sovereignty and how to control populism today. Methodologically, I use philosophical text analysis, text-as-data/NLP, survey research, and causal inference methods.
