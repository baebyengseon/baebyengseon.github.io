Hello. I am a PhD candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University. I study American politics and political theory with a focus on how racial inequalities exacerbate political polarization (both ideological and affective) and thus undermine representation in the United States. My research employs normative and formal theories, historical analysis, and quantitative research methods.
