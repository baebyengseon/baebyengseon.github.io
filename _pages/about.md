Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University, specializing in American political thought and racial and ethnic politics. I am particularly interested in how American statesmen have addressed populism based on racial prejudice and how racial attitudes shape populism and polarization today. I study these topics both theoretically and empirically.
