Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University specializing in American politics with a focus on representation and elections. I am particularly interested in how representation is worsened by racial and economic inequalities and ideological and affective polarization in the US. I study representation and elections both theoretically and empirically using a mixed-method approach that integrates normative and formal theories, historical analysis, and quantitative research methods.
