Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University. My research is centered on American politics and political theory, with special interests in questions of representation, populism, race and ethnicity, immigration, and reproduction in the United States. I study these topics both theoretically and empirically by using a mixed-methods approach that integrates normative and formal theories, historical analysis, and quantitative research methods.
