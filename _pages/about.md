Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University. My research is centered on American politics and political theory, with special interests in questions of representation, populism, race/ethnicity, and demographic change (i.e., migration, birth, death, etc.) in the United States. My research is theoretically informed and methodologically rigorous. To answer my research questions, I analyze survey, election, demographic data using causal inference methods.
