Hello. I am a Ph.D. student in political science at Claremont Graduate University. My research focuses on understanding representative democracy in the United States. I am particularly interested in how representative democracy in the United States was originally designed and has been developed over time, and how it is being undermined by economic inequality, racial conflict, and partisan polarization today. Embodying a mixed-method approach, my research includes not only theoretical studies to obtain normative benchmarks but also empirical works to find evidence to assess representative democracy in the United States.
