Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University. My research is centered on American politics and political theory, with special interests in topics of representation, populism, racial threat, and reproduction in the United States. My research combines philosophical analysis of key concepts (e.g., the concept of representation) with quantitative analysis of survey, electoral, and demographic data.
