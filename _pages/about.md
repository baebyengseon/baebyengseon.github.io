Hello. I am a Ph.D. student in political science at Claremont Graduate University. My research is centered on evaluating representative democracy in the United States. I am particularly interested in how economic and racial inequalities, and ideological and affective polarization undermine representative democracy in the United States. Embodying a mixed-method approach, my research includes not only theoretical studies to obtain the normative benchmark of representation but also empirical works to find evidence to assess representative democracy in the United States.
