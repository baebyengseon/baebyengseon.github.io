Hello. I am a Ph.D. student in political science at Claremont Graduate University. My research examines representative democracy in the United States. More specifically, I am interested in representation, partisan polarization, economic, gender, and racial inequalities, and populism in the United States. Adopting a mixed-method approach, I conduct not only theoretical studies to find the normative benchmark of representation but also empirical studies to evaluate representative democracy in the United States.
