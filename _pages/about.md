Hello. I am a Ph.D. student in political science at Claremont Graduate University. I study American political institutions with focus on representation. I am particularly interested in the original ideas of American political institutions and how representation is undermined by economic inequality, racial conflict, and partisan polarization in the United States. Embodying a mixed-method approach, my research includes not only theoretical studies to obtain normative benchmarks but also empirical works to find evidence to assess representative democracy in the United States.
