Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University. My research is centered on American politics and political theory, with special interests in topics of representation, populism, race/ethnicity, and demography (i.e., birth, death, migration, etc.) in the United States. To answer my research questions, I not only theoretically examine concepts, but also analyze survey, election, demographic data using quantitative research methods.
