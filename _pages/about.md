Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University, specializing in American political thought and development. I am interested in populism, particularly based on racial prejudice, in the United States. I study populist movements in American history and how American statesmen, such as Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, have addressed them.
