Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University. My research is centered on American political institutions and thought, with special interests in the topics of populism, popular sovereignty, representation, polarization, and identity in the United States. Methodologically, I use philosophical text analysis, text-as-data/NLP, survey research, and causal inference methods.
