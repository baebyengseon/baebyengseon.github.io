Hello. I am a Ph.D. student in political science at Claremont Graduate University. My research interest is representative democracy in the United States. More specifically, I am interested in representation, partisan polarization, economic, gender, and racial inequalities, and populism in the United States. My research questions include but are not limited to: When can we say constituents are well represented by their representatives? How do economic, gender, and racial inequalities undermine representative democracy based on the principle of equality? Why do U.S. citizens sometimes elect unqualified candidates? Is polarization harmful for representation? If so, what are causes of polarization? Adopting a mixed-method approach, I not only study to find the normative benchmark of representation but also conduct empirical studies to diagnose representative democracy in the United States.
