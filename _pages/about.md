Welcome to my academic website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University, specializing in American political thought and institutions. I am particularly interested in the principles and purposes of American political institutions as articulated in *The Federalist Papers* and the speeches and writings of Abraham Lincoln, as well as in public trust in those institutions. My research interests include representation, popular sovereignty, federalism, the separation of powers, and judicial review, among other topics. I study these topics both theoretically and empirically, analyzing foundational political texts and the speeches of American statesmen, as well as conducting survey research.
