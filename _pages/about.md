Welcome to my academic website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University, specializing in American political thought and institutions. I am particularly interested in the principles and purposes of American political institutions and the publicâ€™s trust in them. These institutions include representation, federalism, the separation of powers, presidential veto power, the Electoral College, and judicial review. To that end, I study foundational political texts and the speeches of American statesmen, and conduct survey research.
