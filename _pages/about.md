Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University, specializing in American politics and political theory with a focus on racial and ethnic politics, health politics, and American political thought. I am particularly interested in racial prejudice and discrimination and their effects on democracy and public health in the United States. To study these topics, I use various theories and methods developed from philosophy, psychology, epidemiology, economics, as well as political science.
