Hello. I am a PhD candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University. I study American politics and political theory with a focus on how racial and economic inequalities exacerbate partisan polarization and thus undermines representation in the United States. My research employs normative and formal theories, historical analysis, and quantitative research methods.
