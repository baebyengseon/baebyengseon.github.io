Welcome to my academic website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University, specializing in American political thought and institutions. I am particularly interested in the principles and purposes of American political institutions and the publicâ€™s trust in them. My research interests include representation, federalism, the separation of powers, presidential veto power, bicameralism, judicial review, and the Electoral College. I study these topics both theoretically and empirically, analyzing foundational political texts and the speeches of American statesmen, as well as conducting survey research.
