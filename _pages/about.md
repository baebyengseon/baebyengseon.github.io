Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University. My research is centered on American politics and American political thought, with special interests in the topics of American institutions, representation, polarization, and populism in the United States. Methodologically, I use philosophical analysis, text-as-data, survey research, GIS, etc.
