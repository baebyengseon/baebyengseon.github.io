Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University. My research is centered on American politics and American political thought, with special interests in the topics of American political institutions, representation, polarization, populism, and identity in the United States. Methodologically, I use philosophical text analysis, text-as-data including NLP, survey research, and various quantitative and causal inference methods.
