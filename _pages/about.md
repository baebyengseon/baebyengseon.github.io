Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University, specializing in American political thought and institutions. I am particularly interested in how American political institutions were originally designed to prevent populism in a government based on popular sovereignty and how to control populism today. My research topics include representation, federalism, separation of powers, constitutionalism, rhetoric, populism, popular sovereignty, etc.
