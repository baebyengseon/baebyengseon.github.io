Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University. Studying American politics and political theory, I am particularly interested in the principles of representation and the historical development of political polarization and its implications for representation in the US context. My research employs normative theories, historical analysis, and quantitative research methods.
