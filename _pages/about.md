Hello. I am a Ph.D. student in political science at Claremont Graduate University. My research agenda is centered around the fundamental questions related to representative democracy. More specifically, I am interested in representation, partisan polarization, economic and racial inequalities, and populism in the context of the United States. My research questions include but not limited to: When can we say constituents are well represented by their representatives? How do economic and racial inequalities undermine representative democracy? Why do U.S. citizens elect unqualified candidates? Is polarization harmful for representation? If so, what are causes of polarization? To answer these questions, I use theoretical, historical, and empirical methods.
