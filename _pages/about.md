Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University, specializing in American political thought and racial and ethnic politics. I am interested in how to prevent populism in democracy. I study how populists use racial and other prejudices and how American statesmen, such as the American founders, Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, etc., have addressed it.
