Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University, specializing in American political thought and institutions. I am interested in the principles and purposes of American political institutions, as articulated in *The Federalist Papers* and the speeches and writings of Abraham Lincoln, and public trust in these institutions. My research interests include representation, popular sovereignty, federalism, separation of powers, and judicial review. I study these topics both theoretically and empirically, analyzing foundational political texts and the speeches of American statesmen, as well as conducting survey research.
