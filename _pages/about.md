Welcome to my academic website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University, specializing in American political thought and institutions. I am particularly interested in the principles and purposes of American political institutions and public trust in those institutions. Currently, I focus on Congress and the concept of representation, but I am also interested in other branches and mechanisms such as the presidential veto, judicial review, separation of powers, and federalism. I study these topics both theoretically and empirically, analyzing foundational political texts and the speeches of American statesmen, as well as conducting survey research.
