Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University, specializing in American political thought and racial and ethnic politics. I am interested in populism based on prejudice and how to prevent it. I study how populists use racial and other prejudices and how American statesmen, such as the American founders, Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, etc., have addressed it.
