Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University. Studying American political thought and development, I am interested in the principles and purposes of American political institutions and how these institutions have developed historically. My study of American institutions includes the Congress, the President, the Supreme Court, federalism, separation of powers, political parties, representation, polarization, and slavery. My research employs normative theories, historical analysis, and quantitative research methods.
