Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University. I am interested in the principles and purposes of American political institutions and their historical development. I am also interested in American slavery and its historical legacies such as racial threat. My research employs normative theories, historical analysis, and quantitative research methods.
