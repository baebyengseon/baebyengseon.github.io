Welcome to my academic website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University, specializing in American political thought and Race, Ethnicity, and Politics (REP). I am particularly interested in how racial inequality shapes American politics and how American statesmen, such as Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass, have endeavored to solve racial issues. My research interests include American slavery, racial prejudice, racial health disparities, racial threat, and identity. I study these topics both theoretically and empirically, analyzing foundational political texts and the speeches of American statesmen, as well as conducting empirical research.
