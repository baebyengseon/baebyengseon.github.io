Hello. I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Claremont Graduate University specializing in American political institutions and thought. My research broadly examines the principles and purposes of American political institutions and assesses whether these institutions work well today. Currently, I focus on Congress, representation, polarization, and populism in the United States. I study these topics both theoretically and empirically by using a mixed-method approach that integrates normative and formal theories, historical analysis, and quantitative research methods.
